# Syncfusion WinUI Controls

The Syncfusion WinUI Controls are the suite you ever need to create state of art WinUI applications.

## How to best read this user guide

* The best way to get started would be to read the “Getting Started” section of the documentation for the component that you would like to start using first. The “Getting Started” guide gives just enough information that you need to know before starting to write code. This is the only section that is recommended to be read end-to-end before starting to write code, since all other information can be referred when needed.
* Now that you are familiar with the basics of using the component, the next step would be to start integrating the component into your application. A good starting point is to refer to the code examples in the online or offline sample browser that contains hundreds of code examples, as it is very likely that you may find a code example that resembles your intended usage scenario.
* After integrated the component into application using one of the code examples as a starting point, it is likely that you may want additional information on specific features and API. The best option is to search the specific topic using the search box that is available at the top of the user guide.
* Another valuable resource is the API reference that provides detailed information on the object hierarchy as well as the settings available on every object.
