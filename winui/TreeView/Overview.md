The Syncfusion WinUI [TreeView](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.TreeView.SfTreeView.html) is a data-oriented control that displays data in a hierarchical structure with expanding and collapsing nodes. It is commonly used to illustrate a folder structure, or nested relationships in an application.

* `Bound and unbound modes`: Support to bind hierarchical data or add unbound tree nodes.
* `On demand loading`: Support to load the nodes on demand when the end user expands the node.
