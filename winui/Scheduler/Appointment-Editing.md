For example, To use custom appointment editor dialog instead of default appointment editor content dialog you can handle `AppointmentEditorOpening` event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
this.Schedule.AppointmentEditorOpening += Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening;

private void Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening(object sender, AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs e)
{
    //To handle the default appointment editor content dialog by setting the e.Cancel value as true.
    e.Cancel = true;

    if (e.Appointment != null)
    {
        //Display the custom appointment editor content dialog to edit the appointment.
    }
    else
    {
        //Display the custom appointment editor content dialog to add new appointment.
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs%}
