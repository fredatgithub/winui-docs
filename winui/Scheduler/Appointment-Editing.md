## Adding appointments

You can edit the appointments in the appointment editor dialog. These changes will be saved back in the appointment and mapped data object when using data binding.

### Edit recurring appointment

The Scheduler supports editing the recurrence appointment. The following editor dialog will appear when you edit the recurrence appointment to select whether to edit only the particular occurrence or appointment series.

![edit-an-recurring-appointment-using-recurring-appointment-editor-dialog-in-winui-scheduler](Appointment-Editing_Images/edit-an-recurring-appointment-using-recurring-appointment-editor-dialog-in-winui-scheduler.png)

You can also handle the opening of recurrence popup editor dialog using `RecurringAppointmentEditMode` property in `AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs` by handling `AppointmentEditorOpening` event.

### AppointmentEditorOpening event

When you open the appointment editor UI dialog to add or update appointment, then Scheduler notifies the `AppointmentEditorOpening` event.

The `AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs` has following members which provides the information for the `AppointmentEditorOpening` event.

`Appointment`: Gets the selected appointment details which are being updated. It will be null when adding a new appointment using the appointment editor.

`DateTime`: Get the DateTime of time slot or month cell where the user double clicked.

`Cancel`: To avoid the default appointment editor showing by enabling this property.

`RecurrenceEditMode`: Get or Sets the edit mode to perform the edit option to edit the occurrence or series for recurrence appointment. The default value of `RecurrenceEditMode` is `User.`

* User: The default editor content dialog will appear when editing a recurrence appointment to select the edit option from the end-user itself.
* Occurrence: Edit the particular occurrence alone in a recurrence appointment. The default editor content dialog will not appear.
* Series: Edit the entire series in a recurrence appointment. The default editor content dialog will not appear.

For example, to use a custom appointment editor dialog instead of a default appointment editor content dialog, you can handle the `AppointmentEditorOpening` event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
this.Schedule.AppointmentEditorOpening += Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening;

private void Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening(object sender, AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs e)
{
    //To handle the default appointment editor content dialog by setting the e.Cancel value to true.
    e.Cancel = true;

    if (e.Appointment != null)
    {
        //Display the custom appointment editor content dialog to edit the appointment.
    }
    else
    {
        //Display the custom appointment editor content dialog to add new appointment.
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs%}

* `Resource`: Gets the resource of an appointment under which the appointment is located.

## Visible/Collapse the built-in editors in appointment editor dialog

You can programmatically visible or collapse the editors by setting the `AppointmentEditorOptions` property in `SchedulerAppointmentEditorView.` By default, the value of `AppointmentEditorOptions` is set to `AppointmentEditorOptions.All` in the `SchedulerAppointmentEditorView` that displays all the appointment editors. The following code shows how to collapse the `Recurrence` editor by handling the `AppointmentEditorOpening` event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
this.Schedule.AppointmentEditorOpening += Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening;

private void Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening(object sender, AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs e)
{
    e.AppointmentEditorOptions = AppointmentEditorOptions.All |  ~AppointmentEditorOptions.Recurrence;
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs%}
