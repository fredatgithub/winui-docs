# Axis in WPF Chart (SfChart)

[`ChartAxis`]() is used to locate a data point inside the chart area. Charts typically have two axes that are used to measure and categorize data: a vertical (Y) axis, and a horizontal (X) axis.

Vertical(Y) axis always uses numerical scale. Horizontal(X) axis supports the following types of scale:

* Category
* Numeric
* Date time

## Key Features

* Axis supports different type of axis such as Category, Numeric and Date time.
* Allow you to customize the chart axis line such as GridLines, TickLines and support to customize the style of the axis line by defining the [`AxisLineStyle`]().
